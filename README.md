# Simple Shell
This is a simple project I made to learn how a basic shell works and how it interacts with the Linux kernel.

### Features
Currently, it supports the following:
- The `cd` command
- Exiting to the original shell
- Starting processes and waiting for them to finish
- Piping data between processes

### Requirements
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is required to build the project.

### How to run
1. Build the shell using the build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Then, run the start script:
```bash
./run.sh
```

Now you are inside my shell. Feel free to explore and try out commands!
