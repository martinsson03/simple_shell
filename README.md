# Simple Shell
This is a simple project made by me to learn how a basic shell works and to interact with the Linux Kernal.

### Functions
Currently it does support the following:
- The cd command
- Exiting to the original shell
- Starting processes and waiting for them to finish
- Piping data between processes

### How to run
To build the shell, gcc is needed. Run the build script:
´´´
./build.sh
´´´
Then, run the run script:
´´´
./run.sh
´´´

Now you are inside my shell. Feel free to play around!
